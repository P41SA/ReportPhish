<h1>ReportPhish</h1>
<p>This is a script that allows you to report phishing to google in a massive way.<br>
I came up with this idea because, by having a software to collect urls or logos that are similar or use a brand name. Many times we have a lot of scam urls or phishings. So instead of reporting them one by one to Google, I thought it was easier and faster to put them in a txt file and let a script do it for me.</p> <br>

<h3>How to use it?</h3>
<p>
1. Download this repo. <br>
2. Introduce the urls in the <b>urls.txt</b> file. <br>
3. Run the script <b>python3 report_urls.py</b> <br>
4. Make sure your URL has been accepted.
